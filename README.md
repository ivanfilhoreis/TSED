Time Series representation models Enriched with text Domain resources (TSED)

Forecasting models generally use quantitative time-series data. However, external factors can influence data in time-series, such as political events, economic crises, government macroeconomic policy, and the foreign exchange market. This information is not explicit in the time-series and can influence the prediction of the variable values. Textual data can be a source of knowledge about external factors and potentially useful for time-series forecasting models.
